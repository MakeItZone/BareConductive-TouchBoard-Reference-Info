# BareConductive-TouchBoard-Reference-Info

BareConductive is no more ðŸ˜ž

They created a great Arduino compatible board with capacitive sense- the TouchBoard... and lots of excellent information about it, and designing capacitive sensors.

A couple of us have a TouchBoard or two in our kits, and would like to be able to use them in the future. So here is our collection of documentation and other reference information we've collected.

## BareConductive GitHub Repo Forks

We've forked all of BareConductive's public repos.
They have the [`bareconductive `](https://github.com/orgs/MakeItZone/repositories?type=all&q=topic%3Abareconductive) topic.

## BareConductive Website

The [Wayback Machine archive from Feb 22, 2025](https://web.archive.org/web/20250222071324/https://www.bareconductive.com/) seems to be the last complete snapshot of the instructions and reference info.
