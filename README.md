# BareConductive-TouchBoard-Reference-Info

BareConductive is no more ðŸ˜ž

They created a great Arduino compatible board with capacitive sense- the TouchBoard... and lots of excellent information about it, and designing capacitive sensors.

A couple of us have a TouchBoard or two in our kits, and would like to be able to use them in the future. So here is our collection of documentation and other reference information we've collected.

## BareConductive GitHub Repo Forks

We've forked all of BareConductive's public repos.
They have the [`bareconductive`](https://github.com/orgs/MakeItZone/repositories?type=all&q=topic%3Abareconductive) topic.

## BareConductive Website

The [Wayback Machine archive from Feb 22, 2025](https://web.archive.org/web/20250222071324/https://www.bareconductive.com/) seems to be the last complete snapshot of the instructions and reference info.

Here is a direct link to the [resources from that snapshot.](/web/20250222071324/https://www.bareconductive.com/blogs/resources)

**How to Work around the Modal Popup**
- view page inspector, and use the element picker
- click on an empty area of the page; you should select the element: `<div class="recommendation-modal__backdrop"></div>`
- click on the `</div>` just below (i.e. the `div` that contains the modal backdrop); it should select the matching opening `<div>`.
- delete the node (`div`) from the DOM. Modal should be gone ðŸ˜‰
